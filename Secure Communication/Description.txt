MUST HAVE 2 SHELL INSTANCES; ONE FOR SERVER (run first) AND ONE FOR CLIENT (run second). 

The secure communication between the server and client is achieved using TLS/SSL, which encrypts all data transmitted between them.

The server listens for incoming connections on a specific port, uses a certificate and private key to establish a secure connection, and ensures all data exchanged is encrypted.

The client connects to the server, verifies the server's identity using the server's certificate, and then communicates securely by sending and receiving encrypted data.

This ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, preventing eavesdropping and tampering during communication.
